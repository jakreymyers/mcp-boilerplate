# MCP Server Boilerplate (josharsh)

**Repository**: https://github.com/josharsh/mcp-server-boilerplate

## Overview
Boilerplate using one of the 'better' ways to build MCP Servers. Written using FastMCP. A solid, foundational starting point for MCP projects with emphasis on extensibility, security, and production readiness.

## Tech Stack
- **Python** - Core language
- **FastMCP** - MCP framework
- **Pydantic** - Type-safe input validation
- **Multiple Transports** - STDIO, SSE, HTTP support
- **Docker** - Containerization support

## Project Structure
```

├── base/              # Core abstract base classes
├── tools/             # Modular tool implementations
├── resources/         # Static/dynamic resource management
├── prompts/           # Prompt generation and management

└── server.py          # Server instantiation logic
```

## Key Features
- ✅ Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Registry-based component registration
- ✅ Multiple transport layers (STDIO, SSE, HTTP)
- ✅ Type-safe input validation with Pydantic
- ✅ Sandboxed file/directory operations
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Production-ready logging and environment management
- ✅ Docker containerization support

## Implementation Patterns
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy addition of tools, prompts, and resources
- **Base Class Design**: Abstract base classes for core components
- **Registry Pattern**: Centralized component registration
- **Transport Abstraction**: Pluggable transport layer implementations
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized environment handling
- **Security Focus**: Input validation and sandboxed operations

## "Better Way" Characteristics
- **Flexibility**: Multiple transport layer support
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive logging and error handling
- **Security First**: Type validation and sandboxed operations
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new components
- **Best Practices**: Clean architecture and separation of concerns

## Component Architecture
- **Tools**: Modular tool implementations with base classes
- **Resources**: Static and dynamic resource management
- **Prompts**: Prompt generation and management system
- **Transports**: Pluggable transport layer (STDIO/SSE/HTTP)
- **Config**: Environment and configuration handling

## Unique Approaches
- **Registry-Based Registration**: Centralized component management
- **Transport Agnostic**: Supports multiple communication protocols
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic validation throughout
- **Sandboxed Operations**: Security-focused file operations
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation enabling easy extension

## Recommended Use Cases
- Production MCP server deployments
- Projects requiring multiple transport protocols
- Security-sensitive applications
- Large-scale MCP implementations
- Teams needing structured, extensible architecture

## Analysis
This boilerplate excels in providing a production-ready, extensible foundation for MCP servers. The emphasis on modularity, type safety, and multiple transport support makes it ideal for complex projects requiring scalability and maintainability. The registry-based architecture and base class design patterns provide excellent foundations for large-scale MCP implementations.
