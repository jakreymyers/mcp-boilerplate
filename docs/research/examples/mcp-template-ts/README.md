# MCP Template TypeScript (Better Stack Community)

**Repository**: https://github.com/betterstack-community/mcp-template-ts

## Overview
A simple MCP server template for the TypeScript SDK. This is a minimal, community-driven starting point focused on quick setup and standardization.

## Tech Stack
- **TypeScript** - Core language
- **pnpm** - Package manager (evidenced by pnpm-lock.yaml)
- **MIT License** - Open source licensing

## Project Structure
```
/src/                   # Core implementation directory
.gitignore             # Git ignore rules
package.json           # Dependencies and scripts
tsconfig.json          # TypeScript configuration
pnpm-lock.yaml         # Package manager lock file
```

## Key Features
- ✅ Minimal, lightweight template
- ✅ Pre-configured TypeScript environment
- ✅ Standard project structure
- ✅ Community-maintained
- ✅ Quick setup focused

## Implementation Patterns
- **Minimal Configuration**: Focused on essential setup only
- **Standard Structure**: Follows common TypeScript project conventions
- **Community Approach**: Maintained by Better Stack Community
- **Template Philosophy**: Designed as foundational starting point

## Dependencies
- Uses pnpm as package manager
- TypeScript SDK integration
- Standard TypeScript toolchain

## Unique Approaches
- **Community-Driven**: Maintained by Better Stack Community
- **Simplicity First**: Minimal configuration approach
- **Quick Start**: Emphasizes rapid development setup
- **Template Focus**: Explicitly designed as a template rather than example

## Recommended Use Cases
- Developers new to MCP server development
- Projects requiring minimal initial setup
- Teams preferring pnpm as package manager
- Quick prototyping and experimentation

## Analysis
This template excels in simplicity and quick setup. It's ideal for developers who want a clean slate with basic TypeScript configuration already handled, allowing them to focus on MCP-specific implementation rather than project setup.
