# FastMCP Boilerplate (punkpeye)

**Repository**: https://github.com/punkpeye/fastmcp-boilerplate

## Overview
A simple MCP server built using FastMCP, TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier. This is a well-structured starting point for new MCP projects with emphasis on developer experience and code quality.

## Tech Stack
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **ESLint** - Code linting
- **Prettier** - Code formatting  
- **FastMCP** - Custom MCP framework
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD pipeline

## Project Structure
```
/src/                    # Main source code directory
/.github/workflows/      # CI/CD configuration
eslint.config.ts        # ESLint configuration
tsconfig.json           # TypeScript configuration
package.json            # Dependencies and scripts
```

## Key Features
- ✅ Preconfigured development environment
- ✅ Automated testing setup
- ✅ Linting and code formatting
- ✅ Semantic versioning and release workflow
- ✅ CLI interaction capabilities
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow with automated NPM publishing

## Implementation Patterns
- **Modular Setup**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Developer Experience Focus**: Emphasis on tooling and productivity
- **Automated Quality Checks**: ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript ESLint
- **Simplified Server Initialization**: Streamlined MCP server setup

## Dependencies
- Prettier, ESLint, TypeScript ESLint for code quality
- Semantic Release for automated package publishing
- Testing framework (integrated but not explicitly specified)

## Unique Approaches
- **Testing Philosophy**: Focus on "testing the tools you implement" rather than the MCP server itself
- **CI/CD Integration**: Comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow
- **Fork-Ready**: Explicitly designed as a starting template

## Recommended Use Cases
- New MCP server projects requiring robust tooling
- Teams prioritizing code quality and automated workflows
- Projects needing semantic versioning and automated publishing

## Key Quote
> "If you are starting a new project, you may want to fork fastmcp-boilerplate and start from there."

## Analysis
This boilerplate excels in providing a production-ready foundation with emphasis on developer productivity and automated workflows. It's particularly valuable for teams that want to start with best practices already in place.
